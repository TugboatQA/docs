Welcome to Tugboat!

Tugboat is a system that builds a working preview of a website for any branch,
tag, commit, or pull request in a git repository. It can automatically create
these previews for pull requests by integrating with GitHub, GitLab, or
Bitbucket git repositories.

This document aims to provide the information required to use Tugboat. It
includes tutorials, examples, and references for all experience levels.
