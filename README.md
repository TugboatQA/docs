# Welcome to Tugboat!

Tugboat is a system that builds a working preview of a website for any branch, tag, commit, or pull request in a git
repository. It can automatically create these previews for pull requests by integrating with GitHub, GitLab, or
Bitbucket git repositories.

This document aims to provide the information required to use Tugboat. It includes tutorials, examples, and references
for all experience levels.

## Theme

The [Hugo Learn Theme](https://github.com/matcornic/hugo-theme-learn) is included in this repo as a git subtree. To
update the theme, find the latest tag at https://github.com/matcornic/hugo-theme-learn/releases and run the following

```sh
export TAG=2.4.0
git subtree pull --prefix themes/hugo-theme-learn https://github.com/matcornic/hugo-theme-learn.git $TAG --squash
```

## Redirects

Redirects for historic URLs are maintained in `static/.htaccess`. These can be tested using
[Smolder](https://github.com/sky-shiny/smolder) config file in `test/smolder.yaml`. The tests need to be run against a
live instance, like a Tugboat preview.

```sh
cat test/smolder.yaml | docker run -i mcameron/smolder pr125-mcktkhcj8krhxo5oaa7emgv5gcnf5e5l.tugboatqa.com
```
