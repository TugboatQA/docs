Want to delete a Base Preview you're not using anymore? Keep in mind that if you delete a Base Preview that was used to
generate child Previews, those child Previews will grow to their full size, which could put your project over the
[limit of disk space](/tugboat-billing/tugboat-pricing/#how-does-tugboat-pricing-work) available to the project. If you
don't want this, you can [stop using a Base Preview](../stop-using-base-preview/) to stop building new child Previews
from this Preview, but preserve the current size of existing child Previews.

{{% notice note %}} When you exceed the disk space limit in your project, you won't be able to build new Previews until
you are under the project's disk space limit again. You can get under the project's space limit by
[deleting Previews](../../administer-previews/delete-previews/), or
[increasing your project's billing tier](/tugboat-billing/tugboat-pricing/#change-your-tugboat-plan). {{% /notice %}}
