There are a few different ways you can change or update your Base Previews:

- [Change a Base Preview](#change-a-base-preview)
- [Update a Base Preview](#update-a-base-preview)
- [Change the Base Preview Type](#change-base-preview-type)

## Change a Base Preview

If you want to change a Docker image that a Base Preview is using, or make changes to something that happens during the
`init` phase of the Preview build process, you'll need to Rebuild your Base Preview. Rebuilding a Base Preview kicks off
a fresh build process from the beginning, in effect replacing your current Base Preview with a new one that contains all
of your changes.

Want to know more about build phases? Check out:
[the build process: explained](../../preview-deep-dive/how-previews-work/#the-build-process-explained).

{{% notice note %}} If you've checked the [Repository Setting](/setting-up-tugboat/select-repo-settings/) to **Rebuild
Orphaned Previews Automatically**, a successful Rebuild of a Base Preview will kick off Rebuilds of any child Previews
that were built from your Base Preview. {{% /notice %}}

### To Rebuild a Base Preview:

1. Go to username -> [My Projects](https://dashboard.tugboat.qa/projects) at the upper-right of the Tugboat screen.
2. Select the project where you want to change the Base Preview.
3. Click the name of the repo that contains Base Preview you want to change.
4. Click the {{% ui-text %}}Actions{{% /ui-text %}} drop-down menu for the Base Preview, and select
   {{% ui-text %}}Rebuild{{% /ui-text %}} .
5. To confirm that you actually want to change the Base Preview, rather than just updating it, click the checkbox next
   to {{% ui-text %}}Yes, rebuild this preview{{% /ui-text %}} . You may also want to {{% ui-text %}}Rebuild previews
   built from this one when finished{{% /ui-text %}} .
6. Press the {{% ui-text %}}Rebuild{{% /ui-text %}} button.

## Update a Base Preview

If you don't need to pull a new Docker image or make changes to the `init` phase in your
[config file](/setting-up-tugboat/create-a-tugboat-config-file/), you can do a smaller, faster update of your Base
Preview using Refresh. Refreshing a Base Preview:

1. Pulls the latest code from git.
2. Runs commands from the `update` section of the config.yml.
3. Run commands from the `build` section of the config.yml.

Want to know more about build phases? Check out:
[the build process: explained](../../preview-deep-dive/how-previews-work/#the-build-process-explained).

{{% notice tip %}} If you want to pull a fresh Docker image, or if you've made changes to the config.yml's `init` phase,
you'll need to [rebuild the Base Preview](#change-a-base-preview) in order to see those changes. {{% /notice %}}

Tugboat provides a couple of ways to Refresh a Base Preview:

- [Manually Refresh a Base Preview](#manually-refresh-a-base-preview)
- [Automatically Refresh Base Previews](#automatically-refresh-a-base-preview)

{{% notice note %}} If you've checked the [Repository Setting](/setting-up-tugboat/select-repo-settings/) to **Rebuild
Stale Previews Automatically**, a successful Refresh of a Base Preview will kick off Rebuilds of any child Previews that
were built from your Base Preview. {{% /notice %}}

4. Click the {{% ui-text %}}Actions{{% /ui-text %}} drop-down menu for the Base Preview, and select

### Automatically Refresh a Base Preview

You'll generally want to keep your Base Preview up to date with your latest codebase, and a fresh copy of your database,
image files, and other assets. By default, Tugboat automatically checks for updates every night at 12 am UTC, and
refreshes your Base Preview with these updates. You can toggle this feature, or change the time and interval at which
Tugboat does an automated Refresh of your Base Previews.

#### To change Tugboat's settings to automatically Refresh Base Previews:

1. Go to username -> [My Projects](https://dashboard.tugboat.qa/projects) at the upper-right of the Tugboat screen.
2. Select the project where you want to configure auto-update settings for Base Previews.
3. Click into {{% ui-text %}}Settings{{% /ui-text %}} for the repository.
4. Go to {{% ui-text %}}Refresh Base Previews Automatically{{% /ui-text %}} . Toggle the checkbox and/or adjust the
   frequency and timing of these automatic updates.
5. Press the {{% ui-text %}}Save Configuration{{% /ui-text %}} button to save your changes.
