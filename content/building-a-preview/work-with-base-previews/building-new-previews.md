When you're building Previews after you've set a Base Preview, those Preview builds are child builds of the Base
Preview. They use the Base Preview's [build snapshot](../../preview-deep-dive/how-previews-work/#the-build-snapshot) for
things like setting up Services, including pulling Docker images, and pulling in any assets that are imported during the
`init` or `update` phase of the Base Preview build.

When you're working with Previews that are child Previews of a Base Preview, Build and Rebuild start from the `build`
phase, bypassing the `init` and `refresh` phases of a build. This includes:

- [Manual Preview Builds](../../administer-previews/build-previews/#manually-build-a-preview) (when you do not specify
  building from scratch)
- [Previews that are automatically built from pull requests](../../automate-previews/auto-generate).
- [Rebuilding child Previews](../../administer-previews/change-or-update-previews/#rebuild-previews)
- [Rebuild orphaned Previews automatically](../../../setting-up-tugboat/select-repo-settings/#rebuild-orphaned-previews-automatically)

For more info on build phases, see:
[the build process: explained](../../preview-deep-dive/how-previews-work/#the-build-process-explained).

After you've set a Base Preview, you do have one option to build new Previews that do not use the Base Preview: manually
build a Preview from scratch. A Preview built this way is not a child Preview, and behaves like a typical Preview when
Building or Rebuilding.
