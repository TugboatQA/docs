We love automatically generating Previews from new pull requests - we think it's one of Tugboat's best features!
{{% ui-text %}}Build Pull Requests Automatically{{% /ui-text %}} kicks off a new Preview build whenever a pull request
is opened in your linked git repository.

If you're [using a Base Preview](/building-a-preview/work-with-base-previews/), the automated Preview build starts from
that Base Preview. When building previews from pull requests, Tugboat will locally merge the pull request into it's
destination branch, and build from the merged result.

{{% notice warning %}} When you enable this functionality, Tugboat does not automatically build pull requests from
forked repositories. That requires you to set an additional option: **Build Previews for Forked Pull Requests**. Any
secrets in your Preview will be accessible by the owner of the forked repository, so this setting is turned off by
default. Automated Preview Build requests from forked repositories appear as failed Preview builds in your Tugboat
Dashboard. For more info, see:

## To set Tugboat to automatically Build Previews

To configure Tugboat to auto-generate Previews, you'll need to:

1. Go to username -> [My Projects](https://dashboard.tugboat.qa/projects) at the upper-right of the Tugboat screen.
2. Select the project where you want to configure auto-generate settings for Previews.
3. Click into {{% ui-text %}}Settings{{% /ui-text %}} for the repository.
4. Click the checkboxes for the auto-generate features you'd like to turn on/off.
5. Press the {{% ui-text %}}Save Configuration{{% /ui-text %}} button to save your changes.

{{% notice tip %}} Don't see the options to auto-generate Previews from pull requests? You'll need to
[connect your preferred git provider to Tugboat](/setting-up-tugboat/connect-with-your-provider/), and then
[delete](/setting-up-tugboat/select-repo-settings/#delete-the-repository) and
[re-add the provider-specific version of the repository](/setting-up-tugboat/add-repos-to-the-project/) to your Tugboat
project. {{% /notice %}}

## To Build a Preview with Conflicts

Sometimes you may want to build a preview in a pull request, even if it has conflicts with the destination branch. To
build the preview without first merging, delete the automatically created preview and then
[Build a Preview](/building-a-preview/administer-previews/build-previews/) from the _branch_ instead of the _pull
request_.
