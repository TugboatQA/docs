You can build a Preview in a few different ways:

- [Manually build a Preview](#manually-build-a-preview)
- [Auto-generate Previews](#auto-generate-a-preview)

You can also duplicate a Preview using the [Clone Preview](#duplicate-a-preview) option. This is a great option if you
want a few copies of a Preview so QA and Product can both poke a Preview simultaneously, without worrying about what the
other person is doing.

## Manually build a Preview

To build a Preview:

1. Go to username -> [My Projects](https://dashboard.tugboatqa.com/projects) at the upper-right of the Tugboat screen.
2. Select the project where you want to build a Preview.
3. Click the name of the repo that contains the code you want to use to build the Preview.
4. Scroll down to the {{% ui-text %}}Available to Build{{% /ui-text %}} section; by default, you'll see _Pull Requests_,
   but you can switch to view Branches or Tags that are available to Preview.
5. Press the {{% ui-text %}}Build Preview{{% /ui-text %}} button to begin the build.

While the Preview is building, you'll see the Preview appear in the {{% ui-text %}}Latest Previews{{% /ui-text %}}
section, with a yellow status indicator _building_.

When the Preview is ready, the {{% ui-text %}}Preview{{% /ui-text %}} button will turn blue, and you'll see a green
status indicator _ready_. Press the {{% ui-text %}}Preview{{% /ui-text %}} button to view the Preview. While you're at
it, go ahead and [share your Preview](../../share-a-preview/) - we know you're proud of your work!

{{% notice note %}} When you go to build a Preview, you may see an arrow indicating a drop-down menu next to the **Build
Preview** button. This menu contains additional options to build your Preview from a Base Preview, or build with no Base
Preview. For more info on these options, see:
[Building Previews when you're using a Base Preview](../../work-with-base-previews/building-new-previews/).

{{% notice note %}} When you look at your new Preview, you'll see the size of the Preview next to the branch/tag/PR that
the Preview was built from. In the example above, the Preview size is 385.49MB. Because
[billing for Tugboat projects is](/tugboat-billing/tugboat-pricing/#how-does-tugboat-pricing-work), in part, based on
the total size of all the Previews contained within a project, Preview size becomes an important factor when building
out multiple Previews. Check out our section on
[Optimizing Preview builds](../../preview-deep-dive/optimize-preview-builds/) for tips on
[reducing Preview size](../../preview-deep-dive/optimize-preview-builds/#optimizing-preview-size). {{% /notice %}}

## Auto-generate a Preview

In addition to manually building a Preview when you've got an update, you can configure Tugboat to automatically build a
Preview when a pull request is opened, or when a PR is updated with new code. For more info on this option, see:
[Auto-generate Previews](../../automate-previews/auto-generate/).

## Duplicate a Preview

When Tugboat successfully completes a Preview build, it takes a snapshot of the container at that moment in time.
Tugboat uses this snapshot when you {{% ui-text %}}Clone{{% /ui-text %}} a Preview, making a near-instantaneous copy of
that Preview with its own container ID and URL. This enables you to share a Tugboat Preview build with multiple people -
for example, Joe in QA and Lisa in Product - who can then interact with their own version of that Preview without
interfering with what the other folks are doing.

To create a copy of a Preview:

1. Go to username -> [My Projects](https://dashboard.tugboatqa.com/projects) at the upper-right of the Tugboat screen.
2. Select the project where you want to duplicate a Preview.
3. Click the name of the repo that contains the code you want to use for the duplicate Preview.
4. Select the Preview build you want to duplicate.
5. Click the {{% ui-text %}}Actions{{% /ui-text %}} drop-down menu for that Preview, and select
   {{% ui-text %}}Clone{{% /ui-text %}}.

You'll now see a new Preview with the same name as the Preview you cloned.
