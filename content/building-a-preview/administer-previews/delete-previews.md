Need to get rid of a Preview you're not using anymore? Each Preview in your
Tugboat project counts toward the total

   upper-right of the Tugboat screen.
2. Select the project where you want to delete a Preview.
3. Click into the repo where you want to delete a Preview.
4. Select the Preview you want to delete.
5. Click the **Actions** drop-down menu for that Preview, and select **Delete**.
6. Press the **Yes** button to confirm.
