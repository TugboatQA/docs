Want to update or change a Preview build? Tugboat offers a few different ways to do that:

- To update a Preview with your latest code, you can [Refresh](#refresh-previews) it. Refreshing a Preview pulls in the
  latest code from the connected Git repo, and run commands from the from the Tugboat config file's `update` and `build`
  phases.
- To change a Preview's Docker images, or the make changes to Services' `init` commands, you can
  [Rebuild](#rebuild-previews) it. Rebuilding a Preview pulls fresh Docker images, pulls in the latest code from the
  connected Git repo, and runs all of the Tugboat config file's `init`, `update` and `build` commands.

On a basic level, you can think of it as the difference between updating the code (Refresh) and making more substantial
changes to the way a Service is configured (Rebuild). For more info on what exactly is happening under the covers, take
a look at
[the Preview build process: explained](../../preview-deep-dive/how-previews-work/#the-build-process-explained).

{{% notice note %}} When you're updating a Preview that was built from a Base Preview, Rebuild does not pull fresh
Docker images and run commands from `init` and `update`. Instead, child Previews jump directly to the `build` phase. For
more info, see:
[rebuild Previews when working with a Base Preview](../../work-with-base-previews/building-new-previews).

## Refresh Previews

When you Refresh a Preview, Tugboat:

1. Pulls the latest code from git.
2. Runs commands from the `update` section of the config file.
3. Runs commands from the `build` section of the config file.

When you're not [using a Base Preview](../../work-with-base-previews/), Refreshing is a faster process than building the
entire container again, as Tugboat doesn't have to set up Services and complete all the `init` processes again. However,
if you are using a Base Preview, [Rebuild](#rebuild-previews) is the faster update process.

For more info about build phases, see:
[the build process: explained](../../preview-deep-dive/how-previews-work/#the-build-process-explained).

### To Refresh a Preview:

1. Go to username -> [My Projects](https://dashboard.tugboatqa.com/projects) at the upper-right of the Tugboat screen.
2. Select the project where you want to update a Preview.
3. Click the name of the repo that contains the code you want to use for the Preview update.
4. Select the Preview build you want to update.
5. Click the {{% ui-text %}}Actions{{% /ui-text %}} drop-down menu for that Preview, and select
   {{% ui-text %}}Refresh{{% /ui-text %}}.
6. Press the {{% ui-text %}}Yes{{% /ui-text %}} button to confirm and start the Refresh process.

You'll see a yellow _refreshing_ status while Tugboat is running the update, which will change to a green _ready_ once
the update is complete.

## Rebuild Previews

When you Rebuild a Preview (that was not built using a Base Preview), Tugboat:

1. Pulls the latest code from git.
2. Pulls fresh Docker images.
3. Runs commands from the `init` section of the configuration.
4. Runs commands from the `update` section of the configuration.
5. Runs commands from the `build` section of the configuration.

When you're not [using a Base Preview](../../work-with-base-previews/), this process takes longer than a
[Refresh](#refresh-previews), so you should mainly use this if you need to pull new Docker images, or run commands from
`init` in your config.yml. However, if you are using a Base Preview, Rebuild is the faster update process.

For more info about build phases, see:
[the build process: explained](../../preview-deep-dive/how-previews-work/#the-build-process-explained).

### To Rebuild a Preview:
