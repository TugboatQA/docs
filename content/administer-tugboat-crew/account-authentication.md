#### Add authentication methods to a Tugboat account

After you have created a Tugboat account, you can add more forms of authentication:

- [Connect more git provider accounts](#connect-more-git-provider-accounts)
- [Add a password to your email-based login](#add-password-to-email-based-login)

#### Change or update authentication

If you want to change an authentication method, you can:

- [Change your password](#change-your-password)
- [Reconfigure two-factor authentication](#reconfigure-two-factor-authentication)
- [Renew two-factor authentication codes](#renew-two-factor-authentication-codes)

#### Disconnect an authentication method

Finally, to remove or disconnect an authentication method:

- [Disconnect a connected git provider account](#disconnect-a-connected-git-provider-account)
- [Disable two-factor authentication for your email-based login](#disable-two-factor-authentication-for-email-based-login)

## Sign in using a git provider account

For instructions on how to sign into Tugboat using a git provider account, which for many people is the default way of
creating a Tugboat account, view our [Connect with your provider](/setting-up-tugboat/connect-with-your-provider/) page.
Or for provider-specific instructions, jump right to:

- [GitHub authentication](/setting-up-tugboat/connect-with-your-provider/#github)
- [GitLab authentication](/setting-up-tugboat/connect-with-your-provider/#gitlab)
- [Bitbucket authentication](/setting-up-tugboat/connect-with-your-provider/#bitbucket)

To connect with a [generic git server](/setting-up-tugboat/connect-with-your-provider/#generic-git-server), you'll first
need to [sign into Tugboat using an email address](#sign-in-using-an-email-address).

## Sign in using an email address

To sign into Tugboat using an email address:

1. Go to the {{% ui-text %}}Sign In{{% /ui-text %}} link (or if this is your first time using Tugboat, go to
   {{% ui-text %}}Create a Free Account{{% /ui-text %}}).
2. You'll be taken to the [Tugboat Dashboard](https://dashboard.tugboatqa.com/), where you should see a
   {{% ui-text %}}Sign in{{% /ui-text %}} pane.

   {{% ui-text %}}Sign up{{% /ui-text %}} link and follow the account creation instructions.

{{% notice info %}}If you are already signed into Tugboat via a connected git provider, you'll need to go to

## Connect more git provider accounts

Whether you've authenticated via a git provider account or an email account, you can always connect additional git
provider accounts to your Tugboat account. We've covered that process in:
[Connect with your provider -> Adding a link to a git provider](/setting-up-tugboat/connect-with-your-provider/#adding-a-link-to-a-git-provider).

## Add password to email-based login

If you signed up for a Tugboat account by authenticating with a git provider account, you won't have a traditional
password on your Tugboat account. As a security best practice, we recommend adding a password to your Tugboat account.

To add a password for email-based login:

1. Click the {{% ui-text %}}User{{% /ui-text %}} drop-down in the upper right-hand corner of the Tugboat dashboard, and
   select {{% ui-text %}}Profile{{% /ui-text %}}.
2. Go to the {{% ui-text %}}Password{{% /ui-text %}} section of the User Profile, and click
   {{% ui-text %}}Enable{{% /ui-text %}}.
3. Enter and Verify the password you want to use, and press the {{% ui-text %}}OK{{% /ui-text %}} button.
