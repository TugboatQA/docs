{{% notice info %}} User permissions in Tugboat are handled on a per-project basis. When users have access to a project,
they have access to all the repositories within that project. When inviting users to your project, consider whether any
of your repos contain sensitive data; you may want to split those repos out into a different project, where only a
subset of users get access. {{% /notice %}}
