[View the Services of a Preview](#view-the-services-of-a-preview) via its ID; in this case, `5d1a5305216a15d4bf5dcbbb`:

```sh
tugboat ls services preview=5d1a5305216a15d4bf5dcbbb
```

Find the Service ID for the Service where you want to start the shell; in this case, I want the Service ID for the
