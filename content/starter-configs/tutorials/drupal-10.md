Wondering how to configure Tugboat for a typical Drupal 10 repository? Every Drupal site tends to have slightly
different requirements, so you may need to do more customizing, but this should get you started.

The following documentation assumes you are using Composer to manage your Drupal 10 project (typically with either the
`drupal/recommended-project` or the `drupal-composer/drupal-project` projects).

## Configure Drupal

A common practice for managing Drupal's `settings.php` is to leave sensitive information, such as database credentials,
out of it and commit it to git. Then, the sensitive information is loaded from a `settings.local.php` file that exists
only on the Drupal installation location.

This pattern works very well with Tugboat. It lets you keep a Tugboat-specific set of configurations in your repository,
where you can copy it into place with a
[configuration file command](/setting-up-services/how-to-set-up-services/leverage-service-commands/).

Add or uncomment the following at the end of `settings.php`

```php
if (file_exists($app_root . '/' . $site_path . '/settings.local.php')) {
  include $app_root . '/' . $site_path . '/settings.local.php';
}
```

Add a file to the git repository at `.tugboat/settings.local.php` with the following content:

```php
<?php
$databases['default']['default'] = array (
  'database' => 'tugboat',
  'username' => 'tugboat',
  'password' => 'tugboat',
  'prefix' => '',
  'host' => 'database',
  'port' => '3306',
  'namespace' => 'Drupal\\Core\\Database\\Driver\\mysql',
  'driver' => 'mysql',
);

// Use the TUGBOAT_REPO_ID to generate a hash salt for Tugboat sites.
$settings['hash_salt'] = hash('sha256', getenv('TUGBOAT_REPO_ID'));

// If your Drupal config directory is outside of the Drupal web root, it's
// recommended to uncomment and adapt the following. Note: the TUGBOAT_ROOT
// environment variable is equivalent to the git repo root.
# $settings['config_sync_directory'] = getenv('TUGBOAT_ROOT') . '/config';

// If you are using private files, and that directory is outside of the Drupal
// web root, it's recommended to uncomment and adapt the following. Note: the
// TUGBOAT_ROOT environment variable is equivalent to the git repo root.
# $settings['file_private_path'] = getenv('TUGBOAT_ROOT') . '/files-private';
```

## Configure Tugboat

The Tugboat configuration is managed by a [YAML file](/setting-up-tugboat/create-a-tugboat-config-file/) at
`.tugboat/config.yml` in the git repository. Here's a basic Drupal 10 configuration you can use as a starting point,
with comments to explain what's going on:

```yaml
# Default Drupal 10 Tugboat starter config.
# https://docs.tugboatqa.com/starter-configs/tutorials/drupal-10/
services:
  # Define the database service.
  database:
    # Use the latest available 5.x version of MySQL
    image: tugboatqa/mariadb:10.5

    # A set of commands to run while building this service
    commands:
      # Configure the server for the site to run on.
      init:
        # Increase the allowed packet size to 512MB.
        - mysql -e "SET GLOBAL max_allowed_packet=536870912;"
        # Ensure this packet size persists even if MySQL restarts.
        - echo "max_allowed_packet=536870912" >> /etc/mysql/conf.d/tugboat.cnf

      # Commands that import files, databases,  or other assets. When an
      # existing preview is refreshed, the build workflow starts here,
      # skipping the init step, because the results of that step will
      # already be present.
      update:
        # TODO: Copy a database dump from an external server. The public
        # SSH key found in the Tugboat Repository configuration must be
        # copied to the external server in order to use scp.
        - scp user@example.com:database.sql.gz /tmp/database.sql.gz
        - zcat /tmp/database.sql.gz | mysql tugboat
        - rm /tmp/database.sql.gz

      # Run any commands needed to prepare the site.  This is generally not needed
      # for database services.
      build: []

  # Define the webserver service.
  webserver:
    # This uses PHP 8.1.x with Apache: update to match your version of PHP.
    image: tugboatqa/php:8.1-apache

    # Set this as the default service. This does a few things
    #   1. Clones the git repository into the service container
    #   2. Exposes port 80 to the Tugboat HTTP proxy
    #   3. Routes requests to the preview URL to this service
    default: true

    # Wait until the mysql service is done building.
    depends: database

    # A set of commands to run while building this service
    commands:
      # The INIT command configures the webserver.
      init:
        # Install opcache and mod-rewrite.
        - docker-php-ext-install opcache
        - a2enmod headers rewrite

        # Link the document root to the expected path. This example links /web
        # to the docroot.
        - ln -snf "${TUGBOAT_ROOT}/web" "${DOCROOT}"

        # Create any required directories that don't exist.
        # - mkdir -p "${TUGBOAT_ROOT}/files-private"

      # Commands that import files, databases,  or other assets. When an
      # existing preview is refreshed, the build workflow starts here,
      # skipping the init step, because the results of that step will
      # already be present.
      update:
        # Install/update packages managed by composer.
        - composer install --optimize-autoloader

        # Set the tugboat-specific Drupal settings.
        - cp "${TUGBOAT_ROOT}/.tugboat/settings.local.php" "${DOCROOT}/sites/default/settings.local.php"

        # Map your custom modules and themes into the Drupal structure.
        #- ln -snf "${TUGBOAT_ROOT}/custom/themes" "${DOCROOT}/themes/custom"
        #- ln -snf "${TUGBOAT_ROOT}/custom/modules" "${DOCROOT}/modules/custom"

        # Make sure our files and translations folders exists and are writable.
        - mkdir -p "${DOCROOT}/sites/default/files/translations"
        - chgrp -R www-data "${DOCROOT}/sites/default/files"
        - find "${DOCROOT}/sites/default/files" -type d -exec chmod 2775 {} \;
        - find "${DOCROOT}/sites/default/files" -type f -exec chmod 0664 {} \;

        # Optional: Copy Drupal's public files directory from an external server. The
        # public SSH key found in the Tugboat Repository configuration must be
        # copied to the external server in order to use rsync over SSH.  More commonly
        # we use Stage File Proxy, which we enable in the `build` step below.
        - rsync -av --delete user@example.com:/path/to/files/ "${DOCROOT}/sites/default/files/"

      # Commands that build the site. This is where you would add things
      # like feature reverts or any other drush commands required to
      # set up or configure the site. When a preview is built from a
      # base preview, the build workflow starts here, skipping the init
      # and update steps, because the results of those are inherited
      # from the base preview.
      build:
        # Install/update packages managed by composer.
        - composer install --optimize-autoloader

        # Install new configuration and database updates.
        - vendor/bin/drush cache:rebuild
        - vendor/bin/drush config:import --yes
        - vendor/bin/drush updatedb --yes

        # If you are downloading your files from a remove server, you won't need
        # to enable Stage File Proxy.
        - vendor/bin/drush pm:enable --yes stage_file_proxy
        - vendor/bin/drush config:set --yes stage_file_proxy.settings origin "http://www.example.com"
        - vendor/bin/drush config:set --yes stage_file_proxy.settings origin_dir "sites/default/files"

        # One last cache rebuild.
        - vendor/bin/drush cache:rebuild
```
