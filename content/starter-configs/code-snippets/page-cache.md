If your web application has a page caching layer, you can prime the cache from within the
[Tugboat config file](/setting-up-tugboat/create-a-tugboat-config-file/). This code snippet should get you started:

```yaml
services:
  php:
    commands:
      build:
        # Warm the cache
        - 'wget -e robots=off --quiet --page-requisites --delete-after --header "Host: tugboatqa.com" http://localhost
          || /bin/true'
```

Calling `localhost` will cause Tugboat to load the front page of your application. `page-requisites` loads all images,
and `delete-after` removes the downloaded assets to preserve disk space.
