Database management tools such as MySQL Workbench or Sequel Pro are commonly used by developers to work with a MySQL
database. However, Tugboat does not provide a way for these tools to connect to a database in a Preview. A popular
alternative is to use [phpMyAdmin](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/) to fill this gap.

{{% notice warning %}} Exposing a phpMyAdmin service grants full access to the database for the Tugboat Preview to
anyone who has the link. While it is best practice to avoid storing sensitive data in Tugboat, it is still a good idea
to be careful about sharing this link. {{% /notice %}}

You can use the official phpMyAdmin [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin) can with Tugboat.
Here is an example [config file](/setting-up-tugboat/create-a-tugboat-config-file/) showing how you might add a
phpmyadmin service to a Tugboat Preview:

```yaml
services:
  mysql:
    image: tugboatqa/mysql:5-debian
  phpmyadmin:
    expose: 80
    image: phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin
```

{{% notice tip %}} MySQL 8 uses a new authentication method, which does not work with the PHP mysqli extension that
phpMyAdmin uses. To work around this, alter the "tugboat" MySQL user with an init command for the `mysql` service. Your
config.yml might look like this: {{% /notice %}}

```yaml
mysql:
  image: tugboatqa/mysql:8-debian
  commands:
    init: mysql -e "ALTER USER 'tugboat'@'%' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'tugboat';"
```

Once you've added the phpmyadmin service to your Tugboat config, you will need to follow the instructions on the
[Custom Environment Variables](/setting-up-services/how-to-set-up-services/custom-environment-variables/) to add the
following environment variables to your Repository Settings:

- **`PMA_HOST`** - Set this to the name of the MySQL service that you would like phpmyadmin to connect to. In the
  example yml config above, the service name is `mysql`

- **`PMA_USER`** - Set this environment variable to a MySQL user that can connect to the above MySQL service. Typically
  this is the default `tugboat` user

- **`PMA_PASSWORD`** - This is the password for the above MySQL user. The default password for the `tugboat` user is
  also `tugboat`

Once you've added these environment variables, you're ready to build a new Preview with phpMyAdmin. Note that we are
exposing port 80 in the config.yml above, which will give you a separate {{% ui-text %}}Preview{{% /ui-text %}} button
on the Tugboat Preview Dashboard for phpMyAdmin:
