A Tugboat Preview for a [MkDocs static site](https://www.mkdocs.org/) builds the static site within the Tugboat
environment, and then serves it. This config generates a static site that looks like your `site` directory when you
`mkdocs build`, which should be the same thing you see in your local development environment when you run
`mkdocs serve`. However, the Tugboat Preview version of your MkDocs site is accessible via the secure Tugboat URL by
anyone who has the link; no need for the viewer to have a local environment.

## Configure Tugboat

The Tugboat configuration is managed by a [YAML file](/setting-up-tugboat/create-a-tugboat-config-file/) at
`.tugboat/config.yml` in the git repository. Here's a basic MkDocs static site configuration you can use as a starting
point, with comments to explain what's going on:

```yaml
services:
  # What to call the service hosting the site. Because there is only
  # one service, it is automatically set as the default service, which
  # does a few things
  #   1. Clones your mkdocs git repository into the service container
  #   2. Exposes port 80 to the Tugboat HTTP proxy
  #   3. Routes requests to the preview URL to this service
  apache:
    # Use the available version of Apache by not specifying a version
    image: tugboatqa/httpd

    # A set of commands to run while building this service
    commands:
      # Commands that set up the basic preview infrastructure
      init:
        # Use apt-get to download mkdocs into the Apache service
        - apt-get update
        - apt-get install -y mkdocs
        # Clean up apt artifacts to keep the Preview small
        - apt-get clean
        - rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* /tmp/* /var/tmp/*

      build:
        # Use the mkdocs command to build your static site
        - mkdocs build

        # Link the document root to the expected path. This example links the
        # /site directory generated by the mkdocs build to the docroot
        - ln -snf "${TUGBOAT_ROOT}/site" "${DOCROOT}"
```
