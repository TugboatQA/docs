Because Tugboat uses Docker under the hood, every Service in your config file must use a
[valid Docker image address](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/pull/).

Here's what you need to know about working with Service images in Tugboat:

- [How to call a Service image from Docker Hub](#how-to-call-a-service-image-from-docker-hub)
- [How to use a Docker image from another registry](#how-to-use-a-docker-image-from-another-registry)

If you want to pull a Docker image that isn't public, you'll need to
[authenticate with the Docker Registry](/setting-up-tugboat/select-repo-settings/#authenticate-with-a-docker-registry)
from your project's [Repository Settings](/setting-up-tugboat/select-repo-settings/#change-repository-settings).

{{% notice info %}} Tugboat has abstracted away some of the technical aspects of working with Docker images, but if
you're new to Docker, and want to understand more about Docker images,
[check out Docker's documentation](https://docs.docker.com/v17.09/engine/userguide/storagedriver/imagesandcontainers/).

### How to call a Service image from Docker Hub

Tugboat's default image registry is [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/). When you use an `image` key in the Service
definition, Tugboat pulls the corresponding image from Docker Hub.

To call a Service image from Docker Hub, specify an `image` key in the Service definition.

For example:

```yaml
services:
  apache:
    image: tugboatqa/httpd:2.4
  mysql:
    image: tugboatqa/mysql:5.6
```

To dissect the key value in our Apache image key example above, we're calling:

`tugboatqa` : Profile of the image provider on Docker Hub; in this case, it's
[TugboatQA](https://hub.docker.com/u/tugboatqa), the organization.  
`httpd` : This is the specific image we're calling; in this case, it's Tugboat's version of the
[Apache HTTP Server](https://hub.docker.com/r/tugboatqa/httpd).  
`2.4` : **OPTIONAL** version tag; in this case, we're calling for the specific 2.4 version of Tugboat's Apache HTTP
server image. If you browse to the
[supported images in our GitHub repo](https://github.com/TugboatQA/dockerfiles/blob/main/httpd/TAGS.md), you can see a
list of all the version tags available for Tugboat's Apache HTTP Server image.

For more on version tags, take a look at our
[Docker image version tags primer](../../service-images/image-version-tags/).

### How to use a Docker image from another registry

If you want to use a Docker image from another registry, you'll need to specify the alternate registry, since Tugboat
pulls from Docker Hub by default.

For a full breakdown of how to pull from a different registry, check out Docker's Docs:
[Pull from a different registry](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/pull/#pull-from-a-different-registry).

An example of this in action at Tugboat might look like:

`image: registry.example.com:5000/path-to-image/httpd:2.4`
