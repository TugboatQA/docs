  default; Tugboat automatically creates a Preview when a GitHub pull request is
  opened.
- {{% ui-text %}}Rebuild updated Pull Requests automatically{{% /ui-text %}} On

  pull request is updated.

  by default; Tugboat automatically deletes a Preview when its pull request is
  merged or closed.
- {{% ui-text %}}Set Pull Request status{{% /ui-text %}} On by default; Tugboat

  is built.
- {{% ui-text %}}Post Preview links in Pull Request comments{{% /ui-text %}} Off
  by default; Tugboat adds a comment to a pull request with links to its
  Preview. The comment author is the person who authenticated the git repo to
  Tugboat; to change this, see:
  [Add a Tugboat Bot to your team](../../administer-tugboat-crew/user-admin/#add-a-tugboat-bot-to-your-team).
- {{% ui-text %}}Build Previews for forked Pull Requests{{% /ui-text %}} Off by
  default; Tugboat builds Previews for pull requests made to the primary repo
  from forked repositories. **There are security implications from using this
  setting:** any secrets in your Preview will be accessible by the owner of the
  forked repository. When this feature is not enabled, forked pull requests show
  as available to build (or will attempt to build automatically if you have
  {{% ui-text %}}Build Pull Requests Automatically{{% /ui-text %}} enabled) but
  the Preview build will fail.

## Generic Git Server

If you're not using GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, you can use a generic git
server with Tugboat. You'll [sign in to Tugboat](https://dashboard.tugboat.qa/)
using an email address, and when you go to add a repo to your Tugboat project,
you can link to a Git URL.

{{% notice warning %}} If your repo isn't connected via Tugboat's GitHub,
GitLab, or Bitbucket authentication, you won't have the integration features to
automatically build Previews from Pull Requests, and other related
functionality. If you add GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket authentication later,
you'll need to delete your generic git server from your project, and add it
again to use it. {{% /notice %}}
