### Using the GitHub integration

The GitHub integration gives Tugboat the following features, which you can access in your Project -> Repository
Settings:

- {{% ui-text %}}Build Pull Requests automatically{{% /ui-text %}} On by default; Tugboat automatically creates a
  Preview when a GitHub pull request is opened.
- {{% ui-text %}}Rebuild updated Pull Requests automatically{{% /ui-text %}} On by default; Tugboat automatically
  rebuilds a Preview when the corresponding pull request is updated.
- {{% ui-text %}}Delete Pull Request Previews automatically{{% /ui-text %}} On by default; Tugboat automatically deletes
  a Preview when its pull request is merged or closed.
- {{% ui-text %}}Set Pull Request status{{% /ui-text %}} On by default; Tugboat updates the pull request status to
  reflect the state of its Preview.
- {{% ui-text %}}Set Pull Request deployment status{{% /ui-text %}} Off by default; Tugboat adds a deployment update to
  the pull request when a Preview is built.
- {{% ui-text %}}Post Preview links in Pull Request comments{{% /ui-text %}} Off by default; Tugboat adds a comment to a
  pull request with links to its Preview. The comment author is the person who authenticated the git repo to Tugboat; to
  change this, see: [Add a Tugboat Bot to your team](../../administer-tugboat-crew/add-tugboat-bot-to-team).
- {{% ui-text %}}Build Previews for forked Pull Requests{{% /ui-text %}} Off by default; Tugboat builds Previews for
  pull requests made to the primary repo from forked repositories. **There are security implications from using this
  setting:** any secrets in your Preview will be accessible by the owner of the forked repository. When this feature is
  not enabled, forked pull requests show as available to build (or will attempt to build automatically if you have
  {{% ui-text %}}Build Pull Requests Automatically{{% /ui-text %}} enabled) but the Preview build will fail.

## Generic Git Server

If you're not using GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, you can use a generic git server with Tugboat. You'll
[sign into Tugboat](https://dashboard.tugboatqa.com/) using an email address, and when you go to add a repo to your
Tugboat project, you can link to a Git URL.

{{% notice warning %}} If your repo isn't connected via Tugboat's GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket authentication, you won't
have the integration features to automatically build Previews from Pull Requests, and other related functionality. If
you add GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket authentication later, you'll need to delete your generic git server from your
project, and add it again to use it. {{% /notice %}}

## Adding a link to a git provider

Need to add a git provider to your Tugboat account? Whether you created your initial Tugboat account with an email and
now want to add a git provider, or whether you're adding your second or third git provider, here's how to connect your
Tugboat account with additional git providers:

1. Click the {{% ui-text %}}User{{% /ui-text %}} drop-down in the upper right-hand corner of the Tugboat dashboard, and
   select {{% ui-text %}}Profile{{% /ui-text %}}.
2. Click the {{% ui-text %}}+ Connect Account{{% /ui-text %}} link.
3. Select the git provider whose account you'd like to connect.
4. Follow the instructions to connect to [GitHub](#how-do-i-link-tugboat-to-github),

## Authenticating using an API access token

By default, Tugboat uses OAuth to authenticate to git hosting providers. However, there may be times when organization
administrators can't or won't approve Tugboat as an organization-level OAuth application. As a workaround, you can use a
git provider's API access token to add a GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repo to Tugboat.

You'll need to use the [Tugboat API](https://api.tugboatqa.com/) to pass an alternate authentication method.

This example shows how to implement this workaround for a GitHub repository, but you can do the same thing using a
slightly different syntax for GitLab or Bitbucket repositories. If you need help with the syntax for GitLab or
Bitbucket, take a look at
[the API documentation for the `Create a Repository` endpoint](https://api.tugboatqa.com/v3#tag/Repositories/paths/~1repos/post).
If you have other questions about this workaround, feel free to reach out to us for [support](/support).

### Prerequisites

1. You must have administrator permissions on GitHub for the repo you would like to add to Tugboat.
2. You must already have an account on Tugboat and have created a Tugboat project. More on this below.
3. You must be an Admin or Owner on Tugboat for the aforementioned project in #2.

### Implementation Instructions

#### Open a command-line shell / terminal on your local computer

You'll need some environment variables to make this API call.

First, export the Tugboat Project ID for the Project that you'd like to add this GitHub repo to. To find the project ID,
see [How to find Tugboat IDs -> Project ID](/faq/find-tugboat-ids). Then run the following command in your shell,
replacing `[tugboat-project-id]` with this ID.

```
export PROJECT=[tugboat-project-id]
```

If you don't have a Tugboat project, you'll need to create one by connecting any other repository to Tugboat. You can
then remove the repo from the Tugboat Project afterward.

#### Create a Tugboat API access token

Generate an access token in order to use the Tugboat API. Follow the instructions at
[Set an Access Token](/tugboat-cli/set-an-access-token/) to generate your access token.

Once you have the access token, switch back to your terminal and paste in the following line, replacing
`[your-tugboat-token]` with this access token.

```
export TUGBOAT_TOKEN=[your-tugboat-token]
```

#### Create a GitHub personal access token

1. Go to [GitHub -> Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and click Generate new token.
2. Name your token something recognizable, such as "Tugboat for ExampleOrg/ExampleRepo"
3. Under _Select scopes_, check the checkbox next to _repo_.
4. Save the token, switch back to your terminal, and export the token as an environment variable, replacing
   `[github-api-token]` with your new token.

```
export GH_TOKEN=[github-api-token]
```

#### Export additional environment variables

Export the GitHub organization that owns the repository as an environment variable, replacing `[github-organization]`
with your organization.

```
export GH_ORG=[github-organization]
```

Export the Repo name as an environment variable, replacing `[github-repo-name]` with the name of the repository you want
to connect to Tugboat.

```
export GH_REPO=[github-repo-name]
```

Once you've done all the above, you can create an environment variable to integrate a few of these into a JSON payload
that will be sent to the Tugboat API. Copy and paste this directly into your shell:

```
export PAYLOAD=`printf '{ \
  "project": "%s",\
  "provider": { "name": "github" },\
  "repository": { "name": "%s", "group": "%s" },\
  "auth": { "token": "%s" },\
  "name": "%s/%s"\
}' "$PROJECT" "$GH_REPO" "$GH_ORG" "$GH_TOKEN" "$GH_ORG" "$GH_REPO"`
```

#### Make cURL request to the Tugboat API

Once that is complete, you are ready to make the cURL request to the [Tugboat API](https://api.tugboatqa.com/) to
connect the GitHub Repo to Tugboat. Copy and paste this directly into your shell:

```
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TUGBOAT_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -X POST -d "$PAYLOAD" \
     https://api.tugboatqa.com/v3/repos
```
